# Click Up's Mini Project
This project is created in response to the company Click Up advancing me to the next step in the application process.

The mini project is to replicate a Figma prototype and ensure that the website to responsive to be visible on all devices. There is no hard deadline given in the email, but to send a response email once I have completed the project.
